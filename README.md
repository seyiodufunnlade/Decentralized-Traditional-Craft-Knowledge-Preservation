# Decentralized Traditional Craft Knowledge Preservation

A blockchain-based platform for documenting, preserving, and transmitting traditional craft knowledge across generations while validating expertise, tracking apprenticeships, and ensuring sustainable material sourcing.

## Overview

The Decentralized Traditional Craft Knowledge Preservation system addresses the urgent need to safeguard intangible cultural heritage in the form of traditional crafts. This platform creates a permanent, immutable record of craft techniques, facilitates authentic apprenticeship pathways, tracks ethical material sourcing, and establishes recognized standards for master craftsperson certificationâ€”ultimately helping preserve cultural identity and traditional knowledge that might otherwise be lost.

## Core Components
